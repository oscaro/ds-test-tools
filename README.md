`ds-test-tools` is a small library to help test [Datasplash][] pipelines.

[Datasplash]: https://github.com/ngrunwald/datasplash

## Usage

```clojure
[com.oscaro/ds-test-tools "0.2.1"]
```

Then:

```clojure
(ns your.project
  (:require [ds-test-tools.core :as dt]))
```

The only function you need is `dt/run-pipeline`.

It takes inputs as Clojure data, mapping of keys to result files, and a
function to call in order to build the pipeline. It dumps the input data in the
appropriate files; builds a configuration map; pass it to your function; run
the pipeline; collect the results; and return them to you.

### Simple Usage

```clojure
;; Your pipeline
(defn my-job [conf p]
  (->> p
    (ds/read-edn-file (:numbers conf))
    (ds/map inc)
    (ds/write-edn-file (str (:output conf) "/higher.edn"))))


(let [{:keys [result]} (dt/run-pipeline
                         {:numbers [1 2 3 4]}
                         {:result "higher"}
                         my-job)]
  (println (sort result))) ; '(2 3 4 5)
```

#### Specifying inputs

The inputs config map uses the same format as your configuration map. Your
build function should take a map of keywords to file paths:

```clojure
(defn my-job [{:keys [people houses output]} p]
  (let [people (ds/read-edn-file people p)
        houses (ds/read-edn-file houses p)]
    (->> (ds/join-by (fn [p h] [p :lives-in h])
                     [[people :house-id {:type :required}]
                      [houses :id {:type :required}]])
         (ds/write-edn-file (tio/join-path output "housing.edn")))))
```

The pipeline above would use the following inputs config map:

```clojure
{:people [{:name "John" :house-id 1} {:name "Jane" :house-id 2} ...]
 :houses [{:id 1 :name "Red House"} {:id 2 :name "Green House"} ...]}
```

#### Changing the input/output format

By default, it assumes you use EDN as inputs and outputs. You can change that
by setting the `:reader` (used to read outputs) and `:writer` (used to write
inputs) keys in the optional options map:

```clojure
(dt/run-pipeline
    {:reader :jsons  ; or :edns (the default)
     :writer :jsons} ; or :edns (the default)
    inputs-config
    outputs-config)
```

If you have mixed formats or something else than EDN/JSONS, you can also
provide a function of two (readers) or three (writers) arguments:

```clojure
(dt/run-pipeline
    {:reader (fn [k filename] ; k is the key in your inputs-config map
               (case k
                 :my-jsons-output (tio/read-jsons-file filename)
                 :my-edns-output (tio/read-edns-file filename)))

     :writer (fn [k filename data]
               (case k
                 :my-jsons-input (tio/write-jsons-file filename data)
                 :my-csv-input (tio/write-csv-file filename data)
                 :my-text-input (tio/write-text-file filename data)))}
    inputs-config
    outputs-config)
```
